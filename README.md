# Insurance Loss Prediction with Machine Learning

This project explores the use of machine learning models to predict **insurance loss amounts** based on a **real-world dataset** collected from vehicle insurance policies. The dataset includes rich details about driver demographics, vehicle characteristics, insurance policy features, and historical loss amounts.

By applying models such as **Linear Regression**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, and **Random Forest Regressor**, the project aims to estimate potential insurance losses and evaluate the effectiveness of each model using standard performance metrics.

### Key Highlights:

* Worked with a **real-world dataset** of over 10,000 insurance records
* Applied extensive **data cleaning** and **feature engineering**
* Trained and validated models using **5-Fold Cross-Validation**
* Evaluated model performance using **RMSE**, **MAE**, and **RÂ²**

### Tech Stack:

* Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
* Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
* GitHub for project versioning and collaboration
